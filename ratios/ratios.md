## Liquidity Ratios (Measure a company's ability to meet short-term obligations)

| **Ratio** | **Formula** | **Meaning & Interpretation** | **Variables & Explanation** |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Current Ratio** | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | Measures short-term solvency and the ability to meet credit obligations. <br> - Are there enough current assets to meet current liabilities with a margin of safety? <br> - Current assets are assumed to be convertible to cash within 1 year. <br> - Current liabilities are short-term debts due in 1 year or less. <br> - Ratio too high: Inefficient use of assets. | - **Current Assets**: Cash, receivables, inventory (Balance Sheet) <br> - **Current Liabilities**: Short-term debts, payables (Balance Sheet) |
| **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)** | (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities | More conservative than the current ratio as it excludes inventory. Higher is better. <br> - The acid-test, or quick ratio, shows if a company has, or can get, enough cash to pay its immediate liabilities, such as short-term debt. <br> - For most industries, the acid-test ratio should exceed 1.0. If it's less than 1.0, then companies do not have enough liquid assets to pay their current liabilities and should be treated with caution. <br> - If the acid-test ratio is much lower than the current ratio, it means that a company's current assets are highly dependent on inventory. <br> - On the other hand, a very high ratio could indicate that accumulated cash is sitting idle rather than being reinvested, returned to shareholders, or otherwise put to productive use. | - **Current Assets**: Excludes inventory <br> - **Current Liabilities**: Short-term obligations |
| **Cash Ratio** | (Cash + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities | Only considers the most liquid assets. The higher, the safer. | - **Cash & Marketable Securities**: Cash and near-cash investments (Balance Sheet) |
| **Working Capital Ratio** | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | Shows available resources for daily operations. Positive is ideal. | - **Current Assets** and **Current Liabilities** (Balance Sheet) |
| **Operating Cash Flow Ratio** | Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities | Measures if operating cash flow is enough to pay short-term debts. | - **Operating Cash Flow**: Cash Flow from Operating Activities (Cash Flow Statement) |

**What's the Difference Between Current and Acid-Test Ratios?**
<br> Both the current ratio, also known as the working capital ratio, and the acid-test ratio measure a company's short-term ability to generate enough cash to pay off all debts should they become due at once. However, the acid-test ratio is considered more conservative than the current ratio because its calculation ignores items such as inventory, which may be difficult to liquidate quickly. Another key difference is that the acid-test ratio includes only assets that can be converted to cash within 90 days or less, while the current ratio includes those that can be converted to cash within one year.

## Activity (Efficiency) Ratios (Measure how efficiently a company manages its assets)

| **Ratio** | **Formula** | **Meaning & Interpretation** | **Variables & Explanation** |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Asset Turnover Ratio** | Net Sales / Average Total Assets | Measures how efficiently assets generate revenue. <br> - **1**: Each dollar in assets generates $1 in sales. <br> - **<1**: Inefficient asset use. <br> - **>1**: Efficient asset use. | - **Net Sales**: Revenue minus returns and allowances (Income Statement) <br> - **Average Total Assets**: (Beginning + Ending Assets) ÷ 2 (Balance Sheet) |
| **Inventory Turnover** | Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory |<br> - Indicates the number of times a company sells and replaces inventory in a period. A higher ratio implies faster inventory movement and efficient sales processes.<br> - A low inventory turnover ratio might be a sign of weak sales or excessive inventory, also known as overstocking. It could indicate a problem with a retail chain's merchandising strategy or inadequate marketing. Simply put, a low inventory turnover ratio means the product is not flying off the shelves, for whatever reason.<br> - A high inventory turnover ratio, on the other hand, suggests strong sales. Alternatively, it could be the result of insufficient inventory. As problems go, ensuring that a company has sufficient inventory to support strong sales is a better one to have than needing to scale down inventory because business is lagging.<br> - Inventory turnover is an especially important piece of data for maximizing efficiency in the sale of perishable and other time-sensitive goods. Examples include groceries, fashion, autos, and periodicals. An overabundance of cashmere sweaters, for instance, may lead to unsold inventory and lost profits, especially as seasons change and retailers restock accordingly. Such unsold stock is known as obsolete inventory, or dead stock. | - **COGS**: Cost of producing goods (Income Statement) <br> - **Average Inventory**: (Beginning + Ending Inventory) ÷ 2 (Balance Sheet) |
| **Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)** | (Inventory / COGS) × 365 | <br> - Shows how many days inventory remains before being sold. Lower is better. <br> - Shows how quickly a company can turn inventory into cash. | - **Inventory**: From Balance Sheet <br> - **COGS**: From Income Statement |
| **Accounts Receivable Turnover** | Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable | <br> - Measures how effectively a company collects payments, indicating the average time required to collect outstanding receivables. A higher ratio means quicker collections. <br> - A low ratio could be the result of inefficient collection processes, inadequate credit policies, or customers who are not financially viable or creditworthy. <br> - Investors should be mindful that some companies use total sales rather than net sales to calculate their ratios, which may inflate the results. <br> - A high ratio can also suggest that a company is conservative when it comes to extending credit to its customers. Conservative credit policies can be beneficial since they may help companies avoid extending credit to customers who may not be able to pay on time. <br> - On the other hand, having too conservative a credit policy may drive away potential customers. These customers may then do business with competitors who can offer and extend them the credit they need. If a company loses clients or suffers slow growth, it may be better off loosening its credit policy to improve sales, even though it might lead to a lower accounts receivable turnover ratio. | - **Net Credit Sales**: Total sales on credit (Income Statement) <br> - **Average Accounts Receivable**: (Beginning + Ending A/R) ÷ 2 (Balance Sheet) |


## Leverage (Solvency) Ratios (Measure financial risk and debt levels)

| **Ratio** | **Formula** | **Meaning & Interpretation** | **Variables & Explanation** |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** | Total Debt / Total Equity | Measures the extent to which debt is covered by shareholder funds. <br> - **High Ratio**: High risk, financial weakness, potential over-reliance on debt. <br> - **Low Ratio**: Too much equity, underutilizing debt opportunities. <br> - D/E ratios vary by industry and are best used to compare direct competitors or to measure change in the company’s reliance on debt over time. <br> - Among similar companies, a higher D/E ratio suggests more risk, while a particularly low one may indicate that a business is not taking advantage of debt financing to expand. <br> - Investors will often modify the D/E ratio to consider only long-term debt because it carries more risk than short-term obligations. | - **Total Debt**: Short-term + long-term debt (Balance Sheet) <br> - **Total Equity**: Shareholder’s equity (Balance Sheet) |
| **Debt Ratio** | Total Debt / Total Assets | Shows how much of the company's assets are financed by debt. Lower is better. <br> - The calculation includes long-term and short-term debt (borrowings maturing within one year) of the company. It also encompasses all assets—both tangible and intangible. <br> - It indicates how much debt is used to carry a firm's assets, and how those assets might be used to service that debt. Therefore, it measures a firm's degree of leverage. <br> - If a company has a total debt-to-total assets ratio of 0.4, 40% of its assets are financed by creditors, and 60% are financed by owners' (shareholders') equity. <br> - The ratio does not inform users of the composition of assets nor how a single company's ratio may compare to others in the same industry. | - **Total Debt**: Short + long-term debt <br> - **Total Assets**: From Balance Sheet |
| **Interest Coverage Ratio** | EBIT / Interest Expense | Measures ability to pay interest. <br> - **<1**: High default risk. <br> - **1-3**: Moderate risk. <br> - **>3**: Strong ability to cover interest. <br> - When a company struggles with its obligations, it may borrow or dip into its cash reserve, a source for capital asset investment, or required for emergencies. Analyzing interest coverage ratios over time will often give a clearer picture of a company’s position and trajectory. <br> - Looking at a company's ratios every quarter over many years lets investors know whether the ratio is improving, declining, or stable. Some banks or potential bond buyers may be comfortable with a less desirable ratio in exchange for charging the company a higher interest rate on their debt.| - **EBIT**: Earnings before interest & taxes (Income Statement) |

## Profitability Ratios (Measure earnings power)

| **Ratio** | **Formula** | **Meaning & Interpretation** | **Variables & Explanation** |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Gross Profit Margin** | (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | <br> - Shows profitability after direct costs. Higher means better efficiency.<br> - Analyzes the relationship between gross sales revenue and the direct costs of sales.<br> - Companies will have varying types of direct costs depending on their business. Companies that are involved in the production and manufacturing of goods will use the cost of goods sold measure while service companies may have a more generalized notation.<br> - Overall, the gross profit margin seeks to identify how efficiently a company is producing its product.<br> - In general, it is better to have a higher gross profit margin number as it represents the total gross profit per dollar of revenue. | - **Revenue**: Sales (Income Statement) <br> - **COGS**: Cost of production (Income Statement) |
| **Operating Margin** | Operating Income / Revenue | <br> - Measures profitability from core operations. Higher is better.<br> - Companies have a wide range of indirect costs which also influence the bottom line.<br> - Some commonly reported indirect costs includes research and development, marketing campaign expenses, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization.<br> - Operating profit margin examines the effects of these costs. Operating profit shows a company’s ability to manage its indirect costs. Therefore, this section of the income statement shows how a company is investing in areas it expects will help to improve its brand and business growth through several channels.<br> - A company may have a high gross profit margin but a relatively low operating profit margin if its indirect expenses for things like marketing, or capital investment allocations are high. | - **Operating Income**: Revenue - Operating Expenses |
| **Net Profit Margin** | Net Income / Net Sales | <br> - Measures overall profitability after all expenses. A higher margin indicates better cost control and profitability.<br> - Net profit margin takes into consideration the interest and taxes paid by a company.<br> - Net profit spotlights a company’s ability to manage its interest payments and tax payments. Interest payments can take several varieties. Interest includes the interest a company pays stakeholders on debt for capital instruments. It also includes any interest earned from short-term and long-term investments. | - **Net Income**: Bottom-line profit (Income Statement) <br> - **Net Sales**: Revenue minus returns, allowances, and discounts (Income Statement) |
| **Return on Assets (ROA)** | Net Income / Average Total Assets | Shows how efficiently assets generate profit. <br> - **1**: Each $1 in assets generates $1 in profit. <br> - **<1**: Weak profitability. <br> - **>1**: Strong profitability. | - **Net Income**: From Income Statement, profit after tax <br> - **Total Assets**: From Balance Sheet |
| **Return on Equity (ROE)** | Net Income / Shareholders’ Equity | Measures return for shareholders. <br> - **Higher ROE**: Effective capital use. <br> - **Low ROE**: Weak earnings on equity. | - **Net Income**: From Income Statement <br> - **Shareholders’ Equity**: From Balance Sheet |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | (Net Operating Profit After Taxes) / Invested Capital | Measures profitability relative to capital invested. | - **NOPAT**: Net Operating Profit After Taxes <br> - **Invested Capital**: Debt + Equity - Cash |

## Market (Valuation) Ratios (Measure investment attractiveness)

| **Ratio** | **Formula** | **Meaning & Interpretation** | **Variables & Explanation** |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** | Net Income / Total Shares Outstanding | Measures profit per share. Higher is better. | - **Net Income**: From Income Statement <br> - **Shares Outstanding**: From Balance Sheet |
| **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio** | Market Price per Share / EPS | Measures investor expectations of growth. Higher means high expectations. | - **Market Price per Share**: Stock price <br> - **EPS**: Net Income / Total Shares |
| **Dividend Yield** | Dividends per Share / Market Price per Share | Shows dividend return. Higher means more income. | - **Dividends per Share**: Total Dividends / Total Shares |

**Why Use Net Sales Instead of Revenue?**
Net Sales = Revenue - Returns - Allowances - Discounts. When analyzing profitability and efficiency, Net Sales gives a clearer picture by removing distortions from refunds and deductions.
